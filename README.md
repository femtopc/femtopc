With over twentyfive years experience using FreeBSD for Web, mail and File servers, I have built this account to help both first time and experienced FreeBSD users to install and setup networking services. These resources will also be extremely helpful for experienced Linux users that wish to switch to FreeBSD or who just want to make a comparison.

FreeBSD is a complete operating system which includes both kernel and userland utilities. It is a direct descendent of UNIX, which was completely re-written as open source, and follows BSD licensing. Supporting a number of processor platforms, FreeBSD includes both a ports system for compiling applications as well as a package system to quickly install pre-compiled software.

Since the system is very bare bones after initial installation, there are many steps to get different services up and running. To avoid doing repetative work to get services like web, email or other network services installed an working, I have come up with a number of Bourne Shell scripts to help in automating many of these common tasks. Those scripts my be found on femtopc.com and here in this Github archive.
